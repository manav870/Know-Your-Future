# 🔮 Know Your Future 🔮

## ⚠️ WARNING: Your Future May Contain Spoilers! ⚠️

Ever wondered if your palm holds the secrets to your destiny? Well, now you can find out! (Spoiler: It probably doesn't, but it's fun anyway! 🎭)

This is NOT your grandma's fortune teller. This is a **MODERN, HIGH-TECH, SCI-FI PALM READING EXPERIENCE** that will scan your palm with lasers, particles, and enough neon to power a small city! ✨

## 🎪 What Is This Madness?

Imagine if a fortune teller and a sci-fi movie had a baby. That's this project! 

Click the button → Watch your palm get scanned by mysterious glowing lines → See your future (or at least a video we tell you is your future) 🎬

**Disclaimer:** We are 0% responsible if your "future" shows you winning the lottery and you don't. This is for entertainment purposes only! 😂

## 🚀 Quick Start (For Humans)

### Step 1: Get Your Palm Ready! 🖐️

1. Find a palm (yours works best, but we won't judge if you borrow one)
2. Take a photo or find a palm image online
3. Save it as `palm.png` in the `assets/` folder
4. Make sure it's clear enough that our "advanced scanning technology" can see it

**Pro Tip:** If your palm is blurry, the future might come out blurry too! 📸

### Step 2: Prepare Your "Future" 🎥

1. Get a video (any video - could be a cat video, could be your future self, we don't judge)
2. Save it as `future-video.mp4` in the `assets/` folder
3. Make it interesting! This is YOUR future we're talking about!

**Fun Ideas:**
- A video of you winning at life
- A compilation of your best moments
- A cat doing something hilarious
- Literally anything that makes you smile

### Step 3: Open the Magic Portal 🌟

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Click the big shiny button (you know you want to!)
3. Watch the magic happen ✨
4. Prepare to be amazed (or at least mildly entertained)

## 🎨 What Makes This Special?

- **Glowing Lines**: Because regular lines are boring
- **Particles**: Because everything is better with particles
- **Neon Colors**: Because we're living in the future
- **Smooth Animations**: Because choppy animations are so 2020
- **Your Future**: Because who doesn't want to know? 🔮

---

## 🎮 Secret Features (Shhh!)

- Press `R` to reset and try again (because maybe your future will change? 🤔)
- The scanning animation is 4 seconds of pure visual delight
- The video plays automatically (because we're helpful like that)

## 🐛 "Help! It's Broken!" (Troubleshooting for Mere Mortals)

**"My palm isn't showing!"**
- Did you actually add the palm.png file? Check the `assets/` folder!
- Is it named exactly `palm.png`? Computers are picky like that.

**"The video won't play!"**
- Is it an MP4 file? We're not fancy enough for other formats yet.
- Did you name it `future-video.mp4`? See above about computers being picky.

**"Nothing is working!"**
- Did you open `index.html` in a browser? (Not Notepad, we tried that)
- Try Chrome or Firefox - they're usually friendly
